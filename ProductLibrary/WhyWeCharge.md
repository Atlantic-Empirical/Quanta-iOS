# The Short Version:
The membership enables us to focus totally on protecting your data and privacy, and to spend all of our time, energy, and attention on making Quanta delight you.

# The Long Version:
You’ve heard that nothing is free. On the internet it seems that many things are free but you’re always paying in one way or another -- with your data and your attention -- often these sold to advertisers in order to support a business.

The Quanta business is supported by a membership for two primary reasons:

### ONE: DATA PROTECTION

Quanta has no advertising and we do not collect any data other than what’s needed to deliver the service. We do not share customer data with anyone. Instead of thinking about ways to make more money with user data we actually spend time thinking about how we can *gather less* information and discard more information. Read more about our approach in Common Sense Privacy & Security.

### TWO: TOTAL FOCUS ON YOU
This one is simple -- the better we make the product, the more subscribers we will have. So the membership enables us to maintain total focus on your experience, your delight with Quanta. We’re always working to make Quanta more clever, more intuitive, and faster.
