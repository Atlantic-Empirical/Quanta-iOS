**Quanta is a daily guide on your path to financial freedom.**

By providing simple and judgement-free information about your money every day Quanta empowers you to live a more intentional financial life -- making ever better-informed decisions about how you earn, spend, and save your money.

Knowing and tracking the four facets of your money is vital to achieving financial independence and Quanta is built to reveal your money in the simplest and most useful possible way -- with one daily notification Quanta delivers the four facets of your money: In, Out, Owe, Have.

* **In**: How much you actually earn, net.
* **Out**: Where does your money go? Are you living profitably day-to-day?
* **Owe**: How much are you spending to rent money? (eg. on credit cards)
* **Have**: Your savings posture (including 4% SWR for F.I.R.E.)

Together these form your Financial Independence posture and provide a guide to get from here to there.

*Quanta requires no data entry.*  
*Connect your bank and Quanta does the rest.*
